# Larva Core

Larva Core is the foundational system behind **Larva**, an offline-first personal AI designed as a workstation for thinking, planning, and execution.

Larva is not built as a traditional chatbot.  
It is designed as a structured intelligence system where intent, memory, and workflow come before language generation.

---

## Philosophy

Larva is built on a few core principles:

- **Offline-first by default**  
- **User owns their data and structure**
- **Structure before automation**
- **Intent-driven intelligence**
- **Clarity over convenience**

The goal is not to replace thinking, but to support it.

---

## What Larva Is

- A personal AI system
- A project and decision workspace
- A long-term memory and intent engine
- A modular, extensible architecture

---

## What Larva Is Not

- Not a chatbot clone
- Not a messaging or social app
- Not cloud-dependent by default
- Not focused on casual conversation
- Not designed for entertainment

---

## Core Components (Planned)

- **Intent Engine** – Understands what the user wants to do, not just what they say  
- **Memory Module** – Long-term, structured memory with ownership and decay rules  
- **Session Lifecycle** – Manages focused interaction sessions  
- **Core Objects** – Projects, decisions, notes, and tasks as first-class entities

## Project Status

🚧 **Early architecture and design phase**

This repository currently contains:
- Project structure
- Design scaffolding
- Documentation-first development

Implementation will follow once core concepts are stabilized.

---

## Vision

Larva aims to grow into a system that can:
- Run fully offline
- Sync across personal devices (optional, self-hosted)
- Act as a persistent cognitive workspace
